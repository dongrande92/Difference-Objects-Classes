A class is not a real thing by itself. Instead, it works like a plan or blueprint that shows how something should be created. It describes what information an object will store and what actions it can perform. On its own, a class does not do anything. It only becomes useful when it is used to make real objects.
An object is created when a class is turned into a real example in a program. This object follows the rules set by the class. When a class is written, it does not take up memory for its data. Memory is only used when an object is created. At that point, values are stored, and the object can interact with other parts of the program. The methods written in the class can now be used through that object.
One class can be used to create many different objects. Even though they all come from the same design, each object can have its own unique information. It is similar to following the same recipe to make different meals. The steps are the same, but the results may vary slightly. In programming, this allows developers to create many separate objects that follow the same structure.
Using classes helps organize code and reduces repetition. Objects allow programs to represent real life things such as cars, students, or bank accounts. When classes and objects are used together, programs become easier to understand and manage.&nbsp;
